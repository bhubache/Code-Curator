KeyPoints:
  intro: Delete Node in a Linked list. Ok, so the problem is as follows.
  key_point_1:
    0: Write a function to delete a node in a singly linked list.,
    1:
      fade_in_temp_trav: You will not be given access to the head of the list instead you will
      move_first_temp_trav_n: be given
      move_second_temp_trav_n: access to the node
      curve_pointer: to be deleted directly. The constraints
      fade_out_container: are listed below.
      flatten_list: The number of nodes in the given list  is in the range 2 to 100 inclusive.
    2: The node’s value is greater than or equal to negative 100 and less than or equal to positive 100,
  key_point_1_fade_in: The
  _IMPLICIT_WAIT_1: The value of each node in the list is unique And the node to be deleted is in the list and is not a tail node
